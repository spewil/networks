############ NOTES ################

Barabasi Albert model 

each time 't' we add one new vertex with 'm' new edges (length of the bibliography)

we connect these new edges to the existing graph with proportional to degree 

** solving the probability distro is in PSET 2 (only hints, full solution, tackle it and go to office hours)

10,000 = N should be enough to get good info

################ SOLVING FOR P(k) ###################

this is from Barabasi and Albert, 1999, Emergence of Scaling in
Random Networks

(this work rediscover's the Price model)

...the probability P(k) that a vertex in the network interacts with k other vertices decays as a power law, following $P(k) \propto k^-\gamma$. This result indicates that large networks self-organize into a scale-free state, a feature unpredicted by all existing random network models. 

...a “rich-get-richer” phenomenon that can be easily detected in real networks. Furthermore, this property can be used to calculate analytically. The probability that a vertex i has a connectivity smaller than k, 

P[ki(t) < k], 

can be written as 

P(ti > m2 t/k2 ). 

Assuming that we add the vertices to the system at equal time intervals, we obtain 

P(ti > m2t/k2) = 1 - P(ti <= m2t/k2) = 1 - m2t/k2(t + m0). 

The prob- ability density P(k) can be obtained from 

P(k) = \partial{P[ki(t) < k]}/\partial{k}, 

which over long time periods leads to the stationary solution

P(k) = 2m^2/k^3

giving 3, independent of m.
